# learningSocket.io
My attempt at learning about web sockets by building a chat app using socket.io. 
# Note
Instead of just serving static files, I added routes using express and used ejs as the templating language. 
Used the starting template (html & CSS files) from this repo: https://github.com/bradtraversy/chatcord.
